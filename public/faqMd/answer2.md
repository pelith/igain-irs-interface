IRS means “Interest Rate Synth”, an interest rate derivative product launched on iGain, the option trading platform powered by Hakka Finance.

iGain Interest Rate Synth is different from our other product, iGain Impermanent Gain, both are options platforms but are applicable to different targets (Interest Rates vs Impermanent Loss).

The acronym IRS does not refer to “Interest Rate Swap” as it commonly does in the financial sector.

It also does not refer to the “Internal Revenue Service” of the United States. Unlike the latter, iGain IRS will NOT collect your taxes.
