Interest Rate Synth (IRS) is an interest rate derivative product providing DeFi lenders and borrowers a platform to hedge the risk of fluctuating interest rates.
<br>Investors can “long” interest rates by purchasing Long tokens, and vice-versa.

The price of Long tokens is settled by the following equation:

While the Short token is priced at:

<span style='margin-left: 16px; padding: 6px 8px; background-color: #243259'>1 - Long<span>

The amount of purchase needed is determined by the systematic leverage level, while the fixed interest rate is decided by the purchase price.
